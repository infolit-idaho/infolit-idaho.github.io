## Project Team  

We're a group of Idaho library workers intent on making information literacy accessible through OERs (open educational resources).  

## Colophon  

This website is made using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and uses the [Minimal Mistakes Remote Theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter).  

Our "Infolit Idaho" team profile icon is ["Statistics" by faisalovers](https://thenounproject.com/term/statistics/1238357/) from the Noun Project.
